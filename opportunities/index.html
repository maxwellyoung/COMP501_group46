          <h1>Opportunities</h1>
          <p>
            Autonomous cars present a number of opportunities to us to increase
            road safety. The levels of driving ability found within autonomous
            vehicles varies greatly. The current generation of autonomous cars
            are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SEA) as “Level
            2” autonomous vehicles. Future generations of autonomous vehicles
            are defined, up to level 5, being fully autonomous which requires no
            human interaction (Taxonomy and Definitions…, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            Level 2 autonomous cars already present us with a number of useful
            features. Tesla cars, for example, provide a number of useful
            features, such as: Cruise control which matches the speed of other
            cars, automatic lane changing, automatic steering, and stopping and
            starting at lights and signage in traffic. All of these features
            allow for a simpler and more leisurely driving experience for the
            user. Another such example provided by the current generation of
            Teslas is automatic parking, which is when while the driver and car
            are in a parking building, the driver can exit the car, and the car
            will find itself a car park. The car can then return to wherever the
            driver got out from when requested. (Autopilot, n.d.). This allows
            people to save time and effort when visiting places. The popularity
            of these features (Carlier, 2022), despite being largely
            insignificant compared to what could be possible with more advanced
            autonomous vehicles, sets a good precedent for the future of
            autonomous vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In regards to Level 5 (Fully autonomous) vehicles, one of the major
            examples is, provided the technology can be executed well: a major
            reduction in, or even elimination of road fatalities. Due to
            autonomous vehicles not requiring any human interaction, they have
            the potential to eliminate any driver-caused accident, such as
            crashes due to tiredness, carelessness, poor driving ability, or
            other driver error. They could potentially even respond to
            unexpected circumstances on the road much faster and more sensibly
            than any human could. For example, Tesla’s director of autopilot
            software, Ashok Elluswamy, claimed that Tesla’s autopilot prevented
            40 crashes per day where the driver mistakenly accelerates instead
            of braking (Koetsier, 2022).
          </p>
          <p>
            This concept of not requiring any human interaction extends into
            other ideas too. For example, level 5 autonomous cars could provide
            a safe alternative to taxis. Having no driver in a taxi would reduce
            overhead, and therefore provide a cheaper means of personal
            transport. This could possibly take people off the road who may have
            chosen to drive when it would be unsafe, such as if they were
            inebriated or tired. Other opportunities could present themselves in
            more specific circumstances, such as allowing seniors to access
            reliable transport, as they may have trouble getting to public
            transport stops (Shwartz, 2021). Other examples exist too, such as
            allowing business workers to do work while travelling, or even just
            letting people relax while they’re travelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way fully autonomous (Level 5) cars can present us
            opportunities to increase our road safety is by allowing computers
            to take over operations such as traffic lights, or merging. On the
            road, these can be a source of trouble for drivers as for some they
            can be overwhelming situations, and for others, they may be a source
            of annoyance or rage when they’re getting held up by traffic.
            Autonomous cars could, in theory, communicate together via a central
            or decentralised network, allowing them to manage traffic far more
            effectively than any system which involves humans. For example, they
            could calculate traffic light timings, or even eliminate the need
            for traffic lights altogether by using AI to calculate the fastest
            way to get everyone through a junction. Another situation they could
            be useful is in motorways, where they could perfectly merge into
            traffic, preventing traffic jams and accidents.
