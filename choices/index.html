            <i>Note. </i>Self-driving car. From
            <i>Will self-driving cars really need 5G to make them work?,</i> by
            Ericsson, n.d. (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45048264"
              >https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45048264</a

          <p>
            Choices relate to autonomous vehicles in two ways. One is the
            choices relating to the operation of the car itself. This links in
            with the risks regarding autonomous vehicles, as to ensure the safe
            operation of autonomous vehicles we need to make good choices
            regarding regulation and testing. In that regard, regulatory
            agencies and developers alike would want to gain an understanding of
            how the car makes its decisions. AI systems can be incredibly
            complex, so a sound understanding of how it makes its choices would
            be an important factor when integrating autonomous vehicles into our
            society.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other way that choices relate to autonomous vehicles is the more
            evident one, where autonomous vehicles provide us with more choices
            we can make regarding transport. This is similar to the
            opportunities provided to us by the technology. For example,
            autonomous vehicles could provide more choice to elderly people in
            the ways that they get around. Many elderly may have little or even
            no choice as to how they get to places, having to rely on family, or
            taxis if they can afford it. Although public transport is a cheap
            option, many elderly may have trouble using it as it often involves
            walking to and from the stops. They may also have difficulty getting
            on or off buses or trains. This provides a second-order effect
            whereby family members who may have had to dedicate time to
            transporting them around, instead have the choice as to whether they
            wish to help or not. The same concept discussed can also easily
            extend to disabled people or children too. Having a safe and
            reliable mode of transport available without needing a driver
            therefore provides choice to a large section of society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence programs in cars could also prevent drivers
            from making bad choices on the road. As mentioned earlier, Tesla
            reports that their cars “prevent 40 crashes per day for just one
            scenario” (Koetsier, 2022). In this case, it was due to drivers
            accidentally accelerating when they should have braked, however, in
            theory developers could attempt to solve any problem on the road,
            provided they can think of it and find a way to program for it. At
            the very least, this could prevent any number of common accidents,
            such as merging into another vehicle, pulling out in front of
            someone, or failing to stop at signs or lights. Another way
            autonomous vehicles could prevent drivers from making bad decisions
            is by preventing them from having to make a decision in the first
            place. Instead of deciding to drive when tired or inebriated, the
            user can just get in the car and it will take them wherever they
            want to go. “In 2020, there were: 139 fatal crashes, 194 serious
            injury crashes, [and] 1239 minor injury crashes where driver
            alcohol/drugs were a contributing factor…” (Safety - Annual stats,
            2020). It could be argued that if these drivers had access to a
            self-driving car, they would not have made the poor decision to get
            onto the road while under the influence.
