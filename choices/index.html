          <h1>Choices</h1>
          <p>
            There are two choices to consider amongst the rest that relate to AI
            security for open-source software. Firstly, there is the choice of
            assuring the tools protection. In order to fully utilise AI
            security, knowledge of the tool's functionality is necessary to
            ensure safety for users. Open-source software follows steps and
            guidelines established from community feedback, past issues, and
            tests to minimise security anomalies and further understand the
            strength and weaknesses of the software. A survey conducted by
            Rahman et al. (2023) concluded that among the common and major
            variation of attacks on AI learning models, the most prevalent are
            adversarial attacks. To combat this threat, adversarial training
            approaches are employed. The training involves putting the AI model
            in adversarial attack scenarios, which helps the model recognise and
            resist future adversarial attacks. AI security software have the
            ability to learn, which assists with improvement vastly. Security
            tools that improve with each obstacle is the first step to gaining
            absolute security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, another choice is to use secure open-source AI software.
            Secure open-source AI software is an inexpensive alternative for
            those who lack funds for expensive security technology. For example,
            software such as Apache Spot and DeepExploit incorporates AI to
            identify threats and test for vulnerabilities. Both of the software
            are free-to-use open-source software therefore opening doors to
            collaboration, adaptability, and community feedback. According to
            Ahmad (2021), the development of open-source software came with
            benefits such as free alternatives to traditional software,
            developers having more freedom, and accelerated advancements.
            Although they may lack the security levels of those AI security
            tools that comes with licensing fees, small businesses are able to
            rest assured knowing that the open-source nature of their tool
            allows for continuing development. The availability of free
            alternatives to security software levels the playing field for
            developers and organisations.
