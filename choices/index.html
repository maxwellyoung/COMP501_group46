          <h1>Choices</h1>
          <p>
            There are two choices to consider that relate to cybersecurity and
            AI security in open-source software. Firstly, there is the choice of
            increasing the power of the security tools themselves. In order to
            fully utilise AI security, knowledge of these tools functionality is
            necessary in order to ensure safety for its users and lessen the
            gaps in its security. Open-source software has steps and guidelines
            established from community feedback, past issues, and tests to
            minimise security anomalies and further understand the strength and
            weaknesses of the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            A survey conducted by Rahman et al. (2023) concluded that among the
            common and major variation of attacks on AI learning models, the
            most prevalent are adversarial attacks. To combat this threat,
            adversarial training approaches are employed. The training involves
            putting the AI model in adversarial attack scenarios, which helps
            the model recognise and resist future adversarial attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, other implements of cyber security such as regular
            updates and patches and secure coding practices are just as
            beneficial. Ryan et al. (2023) suggests that one of the main
            solutions to vulnerable software, is secure coding practices, which
            as mentioned before is a set of instructions and guides followed by
            a developer in order to gain the most security out of their software
            upon completion. Due to AI having the ability to learn and improve
            from each encounter with security obstacles. The implementation of
            AI in the cybersecurity world has drastically increased the levels
            of expectations for modern day cybersecurity. AI security tools is
            the future, and the first steps towards achieving absolute
            cybersecurity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, another choice to consider regarding cybersecurity and AI
            security is the use of secure open-source AI software. Secure
            open-source AI software is an inexpensive alternative for those who
            lack funds for expensive cybersecurity technology. For instance,
            some free-to-use software are Apache Spot and DeepExploit which
            incorporates AI to identify threats and test for vulnerabilities.
            Both of the software are open-source software therefore opening
            doors to collaboration, adaptability, and community feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Ahmad (2020), the development of open-source software
            came with benefits such as free alternatives to traditional
            software, developers having more freedom, and accelerated
            advancements. Although the security levels of the free-to-use AI
            security software may not match those with licensing fees, small
            businesses and developers can be reassured knowing that the
            open-source nature of their tools allows for continuing development,
            meaning that their security tool will most likely be future proof.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of free-to-use cybersecurity alternatives,
            large companies such as Darktrace and Crowdstrike Falcon gain
            competitors, as there are cheaper alternatives to consider. The
            availability of costless alternatives to cybersecurity levels the
            playing field between large and small developers and organisations,
            which promotes a more inclusive approach to cybersecurity.
