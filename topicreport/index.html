            The evolution of Artificial Intelligence enhanced our lifestyles in
            numerous ways. Now, machines can imitate humans' intelligence and
            can make decisions or perform tasks instead of humans (OCI, n.d.).
            Most common implementation of AI that we can easily access will be
            autonomous vehicles. The demand for autonomous vehicles is higher
            than ever. The top car market leaders compete to deploy the most
            safe and efficient autonomous cars in the market (Forbes, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            Autonomous cars can sense the environment and drive itself without
            any interaction of humans. Autonomous cars are expected to perform
            tasks as humans must do. For example, not only driving itself to the
            destination, but also avoiding any unexpected obstacles or managing
            any kinds of incidents.

          <p>
            However, numerous issues arose after deploying this technology in
            real life and one of the most concerning issues the industry is
            facing is the safety of autonomous cars. Despite the fact that the
            leading technology companies such as Google, Uber or Tesla are
            investing multibillion-dollar to develop autonomous vehicles, the
            fatalities still occurred and killed pedestrians. Uber withdrew to
            develop its own autonomous vehicles after a pedestrian got killed by
            Uber's autonomous vehicle in 2018 (The Guardian, 2020). The most
            accidents made by autonomous cars are caused by the failure to sense
            objects which implement machine learning models built by humans
            (Baecker, 2019).
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, it is certain that autonomous cars must be improved to
            manage every incident for our safety. We believe the car companies
            must deploy autonomous vehicles that are absolutely safe in any
            surroundings and believe it is the biggest obstacle to overcome in
            the car industry.
